Hello, git!
Create commit with tag.
Third change in file.
Fourth change in file. We will try to merge branch here.
Merge: Now I use checkout command.
Next update in file. Master, master.
THERE WILL BE REBASE. ALLYOURBASEAREBELONGTOUS.
AND AGAIN!

Change last commit using git commit --amend

Add string, than comit, then git reverts (REVERT)

Next time we need a REBASE or REVERT or SMTH ELSE.
Because now commit tree looks like crap.
It was happened because of multiple iterations of such response sequence:
commit --amend => pull => merge => push
